# To-Do List App

## Project Description
This project is a simple to-do list application implemented using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks effectively. Users can add, delete, mark tasks as completed, save tasks to a file, and load tasks from a file.

### Features
- **Add Task**: Users can add tasks to the list by typing them into the entry field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete a selected task from the list by clicking the "Delete Task" button.
- **Complete Task**: Users can mark a selected task as completed by clicking the "Complete Task" button.
- **Save Tasks**: Users can save the current list of tasks to a text file by clicking the "Save Tasks" button.
- **Load Tasks**: Users can load tasks from a previously saved text file by clicking the "Load Tasks" button.

### Technologies Used
- **Tkinter**: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI) for the to-do list application.
- **Python**: Utilized for scripting the application logic and handling user interactions.
- **File Dialog**: Integrated for opening and saving tasks to text files.

## How to Run
1. **Navigate to the project directory:**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project files are located.

2. **Run the application:**  
   Execute the following command:
   ```bash
  
## Using the GUI
Use the GUI to interact with the to-do list application:

- **Add tasks**: Type tasks into the entry field and click "Add Task".
- **Delete tasks**: Select tasks from the list and click "Delete Task".
- **Mark tasks as completed**: Select tasks from the list and click "Complete Task".
- **Save tasks**: Click "Save Tasks" to save tasks to a file.
- **Load tasks**: Click "Load Tasks" to load tasks from a file.

## Reflection
This to-do list application was developed to provide users with a simple yet effective tool for managing their tasks. It demonstrates the capabilities of Python's Tkinter library in creating graphical user interfaces and handling user input.

To-do list applications are essential for organizing tasks and improving productivity. By offering features such as task addition, deletion, completion, and file management, this application aims to streamline the task management process for users.

From a technical standpoint, building this application required understanding GUI development concepts, event handling, and file I/O operations in Python. It provided valuable experience in creating interactive desktop applications and managing data within them.

The project highlights the importance of user-centered design and functionality in software development. By focusing on simplicity, usability, and efficiency, this to-do list application aims to enhance the task management experience for users of all levels.

Through this project, I have gained insights into GUI development, software usability principles, and effective task management practices, reinforcing the significance of user-centric design in creating impactful software solutions.
